Propchain
exerciceA : DingDing Bottle Implement a function that follows the following set of rules :
● The function must get one parameter called “n” where “n” is a number..
● The function must loop between 0 and the value of “n”.
● For each number between 0 and “n”, if the number is a multiple of 3 print/log “dingding”, if the number is a multiple 5 print/log “bottle”, if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 print/log “dingdingbottle”, if “n” doesn’t match any of those conditions print/log the value of “n”


exerciceB : Up Down Left Right Implement a function that follows the following set of rules :
● The function must get three parameters called “initialTable”, “isLow” and “isReversed” where “initialTable” is an array of strings, “isLow” and “isReversed” are booleans.
● The function must return an array of string.
● If the “isLow” parameter is true, each string element of the array must be set to lowercase. If the “isLow” parameter is false, each string element of the array must be set to uppercase.
● If the “isReversed” parameter is true, the array must be returned in the reverse order. If the “isReversed” parameter is false, the order doesn’t change.


exerciceC : Kayak  Implement a function that follows the following set of rules :
● The function must get one parameter called “word” where “word” is a string.
● The function must return a Boolean value.
● If the value of the “word” parameter is a palindrome the function should return true. If not, it should return false.
● The case (uppercase, lowercase) of the value of the “word” parameter should be ignored, that is, if the value of “word” is “Kayak”, the function should return true.


exerciceD : The suffering of the keys The keys of the keyboard are suffering a lot when people type one them. The following function will help us know which keys are pressed down the most. Implement a function that follows the following set of rules :
● The function must get one parameter called “text” where “text” is a string
● The function should return an array in which each element has two attributes : “letter” and “count” where “letter” is a string representing a letter and “count” is a number representing the number of times the letter was found in the value of the “text” parameter
